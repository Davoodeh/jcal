# `jcal` library

If you want a Jalali library for your application you are probably looking for
[`jelal`](https://crates.io/crates/jelal).

This is a common library for Jalali and Gregorian date works at high levels for
`cal`- and `date`-like applications. 

There are two binaries that you may be interested in as the final user:

- `jcal` on https://crates.io/crates/jcal-cal
- `jdate` on https://crates.io/crates/jcal-date

There is also another long abandoned project `jcal` (C based) and has no active
forks. These projects are not related in any ways. Moreover, all contributions
are welcome.
